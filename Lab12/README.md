Lab 12-1: many to one (word sentiment classification)  
Lab 12-2: many to one stacked (sentence classification, stacked)  
Lab 12-3: many to many (simple pos-tagger training)  
Lab 12-5: seq to seq (simple neural machine translation)  
Lab 12-4: many to many bidirectional (simpled pos-tagger training, bidirectional)  
Lab 12-6: seq to seq with attention (simple neural machine translation, attention)
